# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) implemented in multiple programming languages, solved collaboratively with Claude.

## Approach

This project takes a unique approach to Advent of Code:

1. **Multi-language solutions**: Each day's puzzle is solved in 17 languages (ARM64 Assembly, C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Bash, Clojure, Common Lisp, ColdFusion, and Brainfuck) to validate correctness through independent implementations.

2. **Parallel agent solving**: Solutions are developed by independent AI agents working in parallel, each implementing the solution in their assigned language without seeing other implementations. When all agents converge on the same answer, we have high confidence in correctness.

3. **Performance benchmarking**: Every solution is benchmarked for runtime, memory usage, and CPU time, allowing comparison across languages and paradigms.

4. **Automated infrastructure**: A Playwright-based runner handles:
   - Session management (authenticated via GitHub)
   - Problem and input extraction
   - Answer submission

## Progress

| Day | Stars | Languages |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| 1   | ⭐⭐   | ARM64, C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Bash, Clojure, Common Lisp, ColdFusion, Brainfuck |
| 2   | ⭐⭐   | ARM64, C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Bash, Clojure, Common Lisp, ColdFusion, Brainfuck |

## Benchmarks

All benchmarks run on Apple Silicon (M-series), averaged over multiple runs. Times shown in milliseconds for precision.

**Note on runtime overhead**: Some languages (ColdFusion, Clojure, Java) have significant startup overhead that dominates these benchmarks. ColdFusion runs via CommandBox/Lucee, which spins up a full JVM and servlet engine for each execution (~2.5s baseline). These languages are designed for long-running server processes, not CLI scripts, so the benchmarks reflect startup cost more than computational efficiency.

## Philosophy

The multi-language, parallel-agent approach serves several purposes:

- **Verification**: When 3+ independent implementations in different languages produce the same answer, bugs are unlikely
- **Learning**: Seeing the same algorithm expressed in different paradigms (functional Clojure, imperative C, pure Bash) is educational
- **Fun**: Solving puzzles in Brainfuck or pure Bash is a entertaining challenge
