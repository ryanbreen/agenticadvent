# Advent of Code 2023 Day 02 - Implementation Task

Solve both Part 1 and Part 2 of the problem.

## Your Mission

You are the orchestrator for solving Advent of Code 2023 Day 02. Your job is to:

1. **Read the problem**: Study `2023/day02/problem.md` to understand what needs to be solved.

2. **Implement in 16 languages in parallel**: Dispatch agents (using the Task tool) to implement solutions in ALL 16 required languages simultaneously:
   - ARM64 Assembly, C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Bash, Clojure, Common Lisp, ColdFusion

3. **Achieve consensus**: Wait for at least 3 independent implementations to return the same answer before considering it correct. This provides high confidence through independent verification.

4. **Submit the answer**: Once you have consensus on the answer, use the submit script:
   `node runner/submit.js 2023 2 <part> <answer>`

5. **Complete all implementations**: Continue until all 16 languages have working solutions.

6. **Benchmark all solutions**: After implementations are complete, benchmark each solution using:
   `python3 runner/benchmark.py "<command>" 5`

7. **Update documentation**: Update `2023/README.md` with:
   - Progress table entry for Day 02
   - Benchmark results table for Day 02

## Agent Dispatch Guidelines

When dispatching implementation agents:
- Use the Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose"
- Each agent should work on ONE language
- DO NOT provide expected answers to agents - they must derive answers from the algorithm
- Agents should read `2023/day02/problem.md` for the problem description
- Agents can reference other implementations for algorithm understanding (after first few complete)
- Each agent must run their solution and report the output they get

## Directory Structure

Solutions go in: `2023/day02/<language>/solution.<ext>`

Examples:
- `2023/day02/python/solution.py`
- `2023/day02/node/solution.js`
- `2023/day02/c/solution.c`

Input file is at: `2023/day02/input.txt`

## Important Rules from CLAUDE.md

- Solutions must output BOTH Part 1 and Part 2 answers (format: "Part 1: X" / "Part 2: Y")
- Never provide expected outputs to agents - they must compute answers honestly
- Submit answers to AoC after verification with 3+ implementations
- Benchmark every solution and record in README.md

Begin by reading the problem, then dispatch all 16 implementation agents in parallel.
